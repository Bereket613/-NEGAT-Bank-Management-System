# -NEGAT-Bank-Management-System
The NEGAT Bank Management System is a simple, interactive banking application built to simulate core banking operations in a command-line interface. This project was developed by Group-3 as part of a learning exercise in object-oriented programming and system design.
🚀 Features

The system allows users to:

🆕 Create a new account – Add customer details and open a new bank account.

📋 Display all accounts – View all registered accounts in the system.

🔍 Search for an account – Find an account using its unique account number.

💰 Deposit funds – Add money to a selected account.

💸 Withdraw funds – Withdraw money if sufficient balance is available.

🔄 Transfer between accounts – Move money from one account to another.

❌ Close an account – Permanently delete an account from the bank system.

👋 Exit – Gracefully end the session with a goodbye message.

🌟 User Experience
Upon starting the program, a welcome message with the bank name is shown, framed with a decorative border for a pleasant introduction. The system operates through a clear, menu-driven interface, making it intuitive and easy to use.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (or specify the language used)

Object-Oriented Programming principles

📂 Project Structure
Bank class – Manages account creation, storage, and operations.

Main driver code – Displays the menu and handles user interaction.

Helper functions – Improve modularity and readability.

🎯 Goal
The goal of this system is to provide a foundational understanding of how basic banking operations can be implemented using structured programming techniques and to give users hands-on experience with essential programming constructs.
